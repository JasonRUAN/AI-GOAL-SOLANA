## One-Sentence Summary

AI-GOAL (AI Goal Planner): A goal management platform that integrates **staking mechanism, social witnessing, and AI planning**, helping everyone achieve their goals more scientifically and efficiently.

## Features

- Users can set their goals, stake SOL tokens, and invite multiple friends as witnesses. If the user completes their goal before the deadline and gets confirmation from the witnessing friends, they can redeem their staked tokens. If the goal is not completed, the witnessing friends can share the staked tokens.
- Users can update their progress with text and images at any time under their goals.
- As an open platform, anyone can view the goals published on the platform, leave comments, and make tips. The tip amount will be added to the user's staked token pool.

It can provide suggestions and feasible plans for how users can achieve their goals, and users can interact with the AI Goal Planner through conversation to better accomplish their goals.
- Platform Revenue: When users or witnesses withdraw staked funds, the platform charges a 1% usage and maintenance fee to ensure sustainable platform operation.
- The platform may issue its own tokens in the future, providing incentives based on user and witness participation (comments, tips, suggestions, etc.).
